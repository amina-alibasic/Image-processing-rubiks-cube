# Image Processing of Rubik's Cube in MATLAB

This program detects the colors of different images of Rubik's Cube (one side of cube in the image).
The colors are put into a 3x3 result matrix at the end of the program (one matrix element for one color). 
Each color position in the Rubik's Cube corresponds the position in the matrix.
